								<h3>Distraction:</h3>
								<p>Some people are concerned by certain aspects of Augmented Reality and the impact it could have on our current lifestyle. By literally augmenting the world around us, it could distract people and lead to accidents.</p>
								<p>Ophthalmologists have known for years the debilitating effects of certain health issues that reduce the field of vision, such as tunnel vision, cataracts, and diabetic retinopathy. Augmented reality wearables such as Google Glass could prove just as detrimental, as the screen takes up a significant portion of the user’s periphery (More info on infographic on the right)</p>
								<p>Peripheral vision provides vital information about speed and distance from objects. Any interference with this process, such as augmented reality hardware, could cause you to misjudge your position and lead to falling or bumping into obstacles. A 2004 study by Salisbury Eye Evaluation confirms this (Sabelman and Lam, 2015). Additionally, it could make you miss impending threats, such as an oncoming car. </p>
								<p>It could prove to be a distraction within the car as well. The dangers of texting while driving are well known: it takes your eyes off the road while moving at high speeds. Augmented reality may prove to be even more distracting, as it takes up more of your vision. Sabelman and Lam (2015) suggest that augmented reality hardware blocking your vision is similar to well-known vision impairments such as tunnel vision or cataracts. </p>
								<p>It takes a certain amount of time for people to shift focus from the real world to the images displayed by the device, much like shifting focus from normal lenses to bifocals. This shift of focus can cause problems not only for drivers, but for slow-moving pedestrians as well. This adjustment time could cause problems for users, especially those with presbyopia, a condition which makes it extremely difficult to change focus. In fact, a 2008 study by John Hopkins university concluded that users of augmented reality may be even more at risk than those with existing visual impairments, as they have not developed ways to compensate over the course of their lifetime (Sabelman and Lam, 2015). </p>

								<h3>Hacking:</h3>
								<p>A less obvious danger when using augmented reality is the possibility of hacking. Since AR hardware requires sensors such as cameras, microphones, and/or GPS, someone could potentially infringe on the user’s privacy by accessing the data from these sensors. Or, a hacker could modify the graphics displayed in the AR environment, perhaps changing the appearance of street signs while driving, or forcing a user to avoid an obstacle that isn’t there.</p>
								<p>The 2016 Emerging Technologies Risk Survey, completed by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University, ranked AR as one of the top 10 technological fields that could lead to serious disruptions if compromised (King, 2017).</p>
								<p>An example of AR technology actually being hacked occurred in 2013. In a controlled test, researchers took advantage of Google Glass’ feature that automatically scans QR codes. They created QR codes that forced Glass to connect to a “hostile” wifi access point. The researchers were able to see all data sent out by Glass, and then were able to “send a web vulnerability to Glass, allowing remote control from the web” (Rogers, 2013).</p>
