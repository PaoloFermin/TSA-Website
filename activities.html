								<h4 class='atitle'>Fun Fly</h4>
								<p>The West Potomac Fun Fly is a day of fun for the whole family! People of all ages can come together and connect over aviation and flight. Anyone in the community can fly their indoor powered RC planes or their lightweight rubber band powered “free flight” planes. Kids can play on a RC plane flight simulator on the computer, or they can create their own paper plate planes at the kid’s table. Mr. Franco's Aerospace 1 students fly their own designed planes for a grade in their class.</p>

								<h4 class='atitle'>NVRC Auction</h4>
								<p>Northern Virginia Radio Control (NVRC) is one of the largest radio control clubs in Virginia with over 200 members. The club includes pilots in all areas of radio-controlled flight: Sport, Giant Scale, Electric, Sailplane, Aerobatics, Combat, and MultiRotor. NVRC has members with decades of expertise to share in many types of flying and building.</p>
								<p>West Potomac TSA hosts NVRC’s biannual auction. At the auction, thousands of dollars worth of RC planes and parts are traded, and the TSA chapter gets a percentage of the profits for being the host. At the event, members of TSA help setup, cleanup, and sell concessions.</p>

								<p class=caption>A brochure advertising RC Mania and listing out concessions prices and sponsors.</p>
								<p>RC Mania was once the largest fundraising event of the year for TSA. It was a weekend event in which families could come and participate in many fun activities. For hobbyists, there were spaces for flying RC planes, captaining RC boats, and driving RC cars. For the young ones, there were pony rides and a face painting booth. This was such as large event that all of the outdoor sports playing fields were needed to fit all of these activities. </p>
								<p>Unfortunately, with the tightening of FAA rules on recreational flight, the biggest draw for the event was lost, and the event was cancelled. The last RC Mania occurred in 2015. </p>

								<h4 class='atitle'>Engineers Week</h4>
								<p>The most important week of the year on the West Potomac TSA calendar is National Engineers Week, or E-week.
